    [ ] F.ToForm -> ToForm

    [ ] rename e.g. PostS, CreateS
    [ ] normalize e.g. `min...Req`, `empty...Req`

    [ ] test/live key checks
    [\] TODOs
    [ ] String -> RequestId (was a `type` in Stripe.Types)
    [ ] tests

  investigate
    [ ] String -> Text
    [ ] handle `mempty` for FromJSON
    [ ] means of pinpointing errors within chained `Stripe`?
      [ ] add detail to `StripeFailure` to track the source of failure

  TH
    [ ] `deriveToForm`
    [ ] `*Id` types & instances

  README
    [ ] flesh out Customer and Plan
  ? [ ] usage expl -> wiki
    [ ] newbie getting started instructions
    [ ] US/USD only right now, but built as an ADT
    [ ] warn -- failures in the middle of chaining `Stripe`s
    [ ] warn -- it's possible to set a connect app fee w/o connect header
    [ ] impove -- probably plenty of places TH could be used

  ???
    [ ] look at Charge data type properties
  ? [ ] rename `StripeErrorCode` to `CardErrorCode`

  \ - metadata
  . - ADTs for e.g. `status`
    - events (webhooks)
    - test Connect
    - Connect fees
    - expanding
    ? `Unrecognized* jsonStr` constructor for all ADTs (FromJSON)?
