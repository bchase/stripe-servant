  README
    cleanup
      [ ] check links
      [ ] renamed `stripe-client` (& exe)?
    notes
      [ ] US/USD only right now, but built as an ADT
      [ ] impove -- probably plenty of places TH could be used
      [ ] warn -- it's possible to set a connect app fee w/o connect header




















  TODO
    - clean up test/
    - ADT for Strip(Scalar/List/Destroy)? (also, `stripeRunner` et al)
    - add detail to `StripeFailure` to track the source of failure
    - something other than `type` synonym for e.g. `StripeClient`?
    - use `deriveFromJSON'` more universally
    - normalize e.g. `min...Req`, `empty...Req`
    - means of pinpointing errors within chained `Stripe`?

    GENERAL STRIPE
    \ * errors -- better Either (status codes; decode fail is currently a `Failure`)
    \ * metadata
    . * ADTs for e.g. `status`
      * events (webhooks)
      * test Connect
      * Connect fees
      * expanding
      ? `Unrecognized* jsonStr` constructor for all ADTs (FromJSON)?
      ? idempotency
      ! flesh out data types (Charge/Customer/Card/BankAccount)
      - sharing Customers (Connect, via Tokens)
      - resources
        * Refunds
        * Events
        * Subscriptions
          - Subscriptions
          - Invoices
          - Invoice Items
          - Coupons
          - Discounts (needed?)
          - Subscription Items (needed?)
          - Tokens (needed?)
        * Connect
          - Account
          - Application Fees
          - Application Fee Refund
    CLEANUP
      - mv resource types & their instances to own files
      - TH `deriveToForm` (grep below)
      - TH `*Id` types & instances
      - mv things to e.g. Resource/Customer.hs, Request/Customer.hs
      - mv StripeTime/Interval/CurrencyCode
      - test/live key checks
      - mv most of this to `Stripe.API` and just reexport public API via this module
      ? rename `StripeErrorCode` to `CardErrorCode`
      ? change `String` to `Text`
