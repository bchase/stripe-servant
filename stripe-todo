    - clean up test/
    - get rid of leading `stripe*` and `Stripe*`?
    - ADT for Strip(Scalar/List/Destroy)? (also, `stripeRunner` et al)
    - add detail to `StripeFailure` to track the source of failure
    - something other than `type` synonym for e.g. `StripeClient`?
    - use `deriveFromJSON'` more universally
    - normalize e.g. `min...Req`, `empty...Req`
    - means of pinpointing errors within chained `Stripe`?

    GENERAL STRIPE

      * test Connect
      * Connect fees
      * expanding
      ? `Unrecognized* jsonStr` constructor for all ADTs (FromJSON)?
